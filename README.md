# My-Kerbal-Space-Program-Addiction-A-Love-Story
Working my way up to rocket science

At the time of this writing, I have accumulated over 3200 hours in the game Kerbal Space Program (KSP). KSP is a surprisingly realistic
and challenging simulation of real rocket science and orbital mechanics.  There are many useful tools out there to help plan interplanetary
rendezvous, but none that I have found are tailored just for the kinds of things I am doing, so I am going to gradually step up my 
python maths to the point where I can simulate the heavenly bodies in-game and plan very complex launch windows and gravity assists!

Besides feeding my feverish addiction to this punishing space game, this application will give me a fun pathway to learning a huge amount 
of math, coding/compsci, and it will result in a genuinely useful application that I can tailor to my needs and will have developed end-to-end.
